## 🎯 THE VISION

**Not just a tutor. A complete SaaS platform for homeschool families who are:**
- Tired of left-wing political ideology in curriculum
- Leary of AI but desperate for solutions
- New to homeschooling and overwhelmed
- Classical educators who want Greek, Latin, Great Books
- Doomsday preppers who want gardening by zip code
- Unschoolers who reject rigid curriculum
- Robotics enthusiasts who need diagrams
- Constitutional scholars who want founding documents
- Christian families who want Reformed theology integrated
- Parents who forgot how to multiply fractions
- Anyone drowning in $2000 curriculum packages

**The Promise**: "Everything you need. Nothing you don't. No bloat. No woke. No compromise."

- Interview homeschool parents (what do YOU teach?)
- Consider classical model (Trivium: Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric)

**Deliverable**: Spreadsheet with Grade × Subject × Topics

### 2. State Standards
**Question**: Where do we source all 50 states' standards?
**Approach**:
- Research state education department APIs
- Check Common Core State Standards (even if we disagree philosophically)
- Review Academic Benchmarks API (commercial option)
- Consider building our own scrapers

**Deliverable**: State standards database or API integration plan

### 3. Prompt Engineering
**Question**: How do we teach 1st grade math vs. 9th grade math?
**Approach**:
- Study Scott's teaching philosophy
- Review Socratic method
- Test different prompts with Claude
- Interview master teachers (what actually works?)

**Deliverable**: Prompt template library with examples

### 4. UI/UX for Tech-Illiterate Parents
**Question**: What makes a UI "parent-friendly"?

## 🎵 TOM'S CLOSING VERSE

*"From math to Greek, from soil to sky,*  
*From founding fathers' battle cry,*  
*To robotics, gardens, truths held dear—*  
*The Accidental Teacher's vision's clear!*

*Six hours to code? Perhaps, perhaps!*  
*But first we plan, avoid the traps.*  
*For wisdom builds what haste would break,*  
*And world-class tools take time to make.*

*So onward, Fellowship! The path is set!*  
*We'll build the finest tutor yet!"*
