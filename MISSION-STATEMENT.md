# MISSION STATEMENT & CORE VALUES
**The Accidental Teacher - Immutable Principles**

**Date Created**: December 6, 2025  
**Last Updated**: December 6, 2025  
**Status**: PERMANENT - These values do not change

---

## 🎯 PRIMARY MISSION

**Build the first AI tutoring platform specifically for Christian homeschool families that:**
1. Meets kids where they are (not where curriculum designers think they should be)
2. Costs 75% less than traditional curriculum ($299/year vs. $1,200+)
3. Integrates biblical worldview naturally (YEC, OEC, or Secular options)
4. Teaches parents HOW to teach (parent coach mode)
5. Eliminates bloat and woke ideology

**In one sentence**: "AI-enhanced homeschool education that actually cares about kids and respects Christian values."

---

## 🛡️ FIVE NON-NEGOTIABLES

These principles are immutable. Any feature, business decision, or partnership must align with these:

### 1. Meet Kids Where They Are
**What it means:**
- Curriculum adapts to student's actual level, not their age/grade
- Struggling students get micro-steps and extra scaffolding
- Gifted students get challenges and minimal hand-holding
- Special needs (ADHD, dyslexia, ESL) get appropriate accommodations

**What it's NOT:**
- One-size-fits-all curriculum
- "Age-appropriate" standards that ignore reality
- Rigid pacing guides that shame struggling learners

**Example:** A 5th grader reading at 2nd grade level gets 2nd grade content, not watered-down 5th grade. No shame, just progress.

---

### 2. AI-Enhanced Personalization
**What it means:**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (or successor) powers all tutoring
- Dynamic prompt templates merge student profile + subject + worldview
- Real-time adaptation based on student responses
- Parent coaching mode teaches parents HOW to teach

**What it's NOT:**
- Generic ChatGPT wrapper with no customization
- Automated grading with canned responses
- Surveillance AI that reports to districts

**Example:** Emily (Grade 3, struggling, YEC worldview) gets different math explanations than Jake (Grade 3, gifted, secular worldview) - same topic, personalized approach.

---

### 3. Gamified Learning
**What it means:**
- Learning should be irresistible, not insufferable
- Badges, streaks, celebrations for progress
- Scott's MAPS project approach (meaningful engagement)
- Fun without sacrificing rigor

**What it's NOT:**
- Candy Crush-style distractions
- Points for busywork
- Shallow "edutainment" with no substance

**Example:** Student completes 7 days of math practice → "Great Commendation" badge + encouraging message + mastery visualization.

---

### 4. Cut the Bloat
**What it means:**
- Give families what they WANT, nothing they don't
- No forced subjects (if you don't want art, don't pay for art)
- No 300-page teacher's manuals
- No vendor lock-in or upsell tricks

**What it's NOT:**
- $2,000 curriculum packages with unused books
- Subscription bundles that include junk
- "Comprehensive" programs that overwhelm parents

**Example:** Parent wants Math + Reading only → Pays for Math + Reading only. No forced bundles. No hidden fees.

---

### 5. Relationship-Focused
**What it means:**
- "My life is better because you're in it" philosophy
- AI tutors celebrate effort, not just results
- Parent coaching is empathetic, not condescending
- Community features connect families

**What it's NOT:**
- Cold, clinical "learning management system"
- Behavior tracking and surveillance
- Shaming language for mistakes

**Example:** Student struggles with fractions for 3rd time → AI says: "Fractions are tough! Let's break this down together. I'm proud of you for sticking with it."

---

## 🕊️ THEOLOGICAL COMMITMENTS

### Reformed Baptist Foundation
**Scott's Worldview**: Reformed Baptist (1689 London Baptist Confession)

**How This Shows Up**:
- Young Earth Creationism (YEC) as default worldview option
- Scripture references naturally integrated when appropriate
- Truth, goodness, beauty as educational goals
- Classical Christian education compatible

**But Also**:
- Old Earth Creationism (OEC) option for families who hold that view
- Theistic Evolution option (debated, but some Reformed hold it)
- Secular/neutral option for families who prefer no theology

**What We DON'T Do**:
- Force Scott's exact theology on everyone
- Exclude families with different views
- Mock or belittle non-Reformed Christians
- Ignore non-Christian families who want quality education

**Balance**: Lead with Reformed Baptist values, but make room for others.

---

## 🚫 WHAT WE WILL NEVER DO

### Ideological Red Lines

**1. We will NEVER push woke ideology**

**2. We will NEVER exploit families financially**
- No hidden fees or surprise charges
- No forcing unnecessary curriculum purchases

- No selling behavioral data to advertisers
- No mandatory state standardized test prep
- Parent owns and controls all student data

**4. We will NEVER abandon quality for scale**
- No cutting corners to chase growth
- No diluting Scott's teaching philosophy
- No corporate takeover that destroys mission
- Quality over quantity, always

**5. We will NEVER forget who we serve**
- Families, not investors
- Students, not data points
- Parents, not bureaucrats
- Real people, not market segments

## 📐 PEDAGOGICAL PRINCIPLES

### Scott's Teaching Philosophy
1. **Sit on the floor with crying kids** (incarnational education)
2. **"My life is better because you're in it"** (relationship first)
3. **Meet kids where they are** (not where standards say)
4. **Celebrate effort, not just results** (growth mindset)
5. **Make learning irresistible** (gamification with purpose)

### Prompt Template Strategy
**48 Templates** (immutable categories):
- Base (3): student-tutor, parent-coach, prerequisite-check
- Teaching Modes (5): struggling, gifted, ADHD, dyslexia, ESL
- Worldviews (3): YEC, OEC, Secular
- Subject-Specific (34): Math, Reading, Science, History, Languages, etc.
- Special (3): grammar, celebration, standards

**How Templates Work**:
1. System loads base template
2. Adds teaching mode based on student performance
3. Adds worldview based on family preference
4. Adds subject-specific teaching strategies
5. Injects variables (name, grade, topic)
6. Sends ~8,000 token prompt to Claude

**Result**: Every student gets personalized AI tutor that:
- Speaks at their grade level
- Adapts to their learning style
- Respects their family's worldview
- Uses proven teaching strategies for that subject

---

## 🌍 WORLDVIEW INTEGRATION

### Three Worldview Options

**1. Young Earth Creationism (YEC) - Default**
- 6,000-10,000 year old earth
- Six 24-hour creation days
- Global flood (Noah)
- Biblical authority in science
- Examples: Ken Ham (Answers in Genesis), John MacArthur

**2. Old Earth Creationism (OEC)**
- Billions of years (Big Bang compatible)
- God-guided creation process
- Day-age or framework interpretation
- Science and Scripture harmonize
- Examples: Hugh Ross (Reasons to Believe), William Lane Craig

**3. Secular/Neutral**
- No religious content
- Standard scientific consensus
- Evolution taught as fact
- For non-Christian families or those who prefer separation

**How It Works in Practice**:

| Topic | YEC Approach | OEC Approach | Secular Approach |
|-------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Age of Earth** | 6,000-10,000 years | 4.5 billion years | 4.5 billion years |
| **Dinosaurs** | Created Day 6, extinct post-flood | Ancient creatures, millions of years ago | Extinct 65 million years ago |
| **Fossils** | Rapid burial in global flood | Geological time scale | Geological time scale |
| **Human Origins** | Adam and Eve, special creation | Adam and Eve, but longer timeline | Evolution from primates |
| **Science Method** | Operational science (observable) | Standard scientific method | Standard scientific method |

**Key Principle**: Truth matters. We present what each worldview actually teaches, not a watered-down compromise.

## 🏔️ THE ALASKA FACTOR

### Why Glennallen Matters

**Scott's School Context**:
- Population: 439
- Copper River School District
- Title 1 (high poverty, federal funding)
- 65% Alaska Native (Ahtna Athabascan)
- -50°F winters
- 189 miles from Anchorage

**Why This Proves Our Mission**:
1. **If it works in Alaska, it works anywhere** - Harshest educational environment
2. **Scott teaches real kids** - Not theory, actual results
3. **Diverse learners** - Special needs, ESL, poverty, rural isolation
4. **Cultural respect** - Alaska Native integration shows we value all cultures
5. **Resource scarcity** - Limited materials, must be creative

**Alaska-Specific Curriculum** (Future):
- Ahtna language lessons
- Subsistence hunting/fishing education
- Alaska Native history and culture
- Extreme climate survival skills
- Food preservation (permafrost cellars)

This isn't just flavor text. It's proof Scott's philosophy works in real classrooms with real challenges.

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS (What Actually Matters)

### Metrics We Care About
1. **Student Mastery** - Are kids actually learning?
2. **Parent Confidence** - Do parents feel equipped to teach?
3. **Family Affordability** - Are we saving families money?
4. **Worldview Integrity** - Is biblical content accurate?
5. **Community Testimonials** - Do families love us?

### Metrics We DON'T Optimize For
1. **Venture Capital ROI** - Not our master
2. **User Growth at All Costs** - Quality over quantity
3. **Time on Platform** - We want efficient learning, not addiction
4. **Data Collection** - We're not selling surveillance
5. **Test Score Manipulation** - Real learning, not gaming metrics

## 💪 WHEN WE'RE TEMPTED TO DRIFT

### Red Flag Questions to Ask:

**1. "This feature would increase engagement..."**
- Does it serve kids, or just addiction metrics?
- Would Scott do this in his classroom?

**2. "This investor wants us to..."**
- Does it align with our five non-negotiables?
- Would it compromise worldview integrity?

**3. "Our competitor is doing..."**
- Are they serving families or exploiting them?
- Does their approach honor God?

**4. "We could make more money if..."**
- At what cost to mission?
- Would we be proud of this in 10 years?

**5. "Public schools are interested in..."**
- Can we maintain privacy and autonomy?
- Would this turn us into a surveillance tool?

### Anchoring Scripture

**Proverbs 22:6** - "Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it."

**Deuteronomy 6:6-7** - "These words... shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children..."

**Colossians 2:8** - "See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition..."

**Romans 5:3-4** - "Suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; character, hope." (Scott's weight loss journey)
