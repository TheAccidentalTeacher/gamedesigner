## 🚀 HOW TO USE YOUR AGENT COUNCIL

### **Single Expert Mode** (Most Common)
1. Open AI Assistant in the game editor
2. Select persona from dropdown (e.g., "Alex Chen - Technical Architect")
3. Ask your question
4. Get deep, researched, persona-specific response

**Example**:
> **Selected**: Dr. Sarah Bennett (Master Teacher)  
> **You ask**: "How do I teach fractions to a 5th grader struggling with multiplication?"  
> **She responds**: With Bloom's Taxonomy scaffolding, pre-assessment strategy, and MAPS-style adaptive pathways

---

### **Council Mode** (For Complex Decisions)
When you need multiple perspectives, ask one persona to simulate a council discussion:

**Example**:
> **Selected**: Marcus Sterling (Strategist)  
> **You ask**: "I need to decide: bootstrap Tier 1 or raise Tier 2 capital from Greg. Can you facilitate a council discussion with Sarah (education impact), Alex (technical feasibility), and Pastor Jonathan (mission alignment)?"  
> **He responds**: Synthesizes perspectives from all three domains, gives recommendation

**OR manually**:
1. Ask Alex (Technical): "What's technically feasible in 6 months?"
2. Ask Marcus (Strategist): "What's the financial/market reality?"
3. Ask Pastor Jonathan (Theologian): "Does this protect our mission?"
4. Synthesize yourself

---

### **Sequential Consulting**
Use different personas in sequence for a project:

**Example Project**: "Build landing page for The Accidental Teacher"

1. **Marcus (Strategist)**: "What should my value proposition be?"
2. **Emma (Writer)**: "Write the hero section copy using StoryBrand"
3. **Alex (Technical)**: "What tech stack for the landing page?"
4. **Riley (UX Designer)**: "Critique the wireframe I sketched"
5. **David (Marketing)**: "What CTAs should I test?"
