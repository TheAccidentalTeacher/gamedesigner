# SCOTT SOMERS - THE ACCIDENTAL TEACHER
*Meet kids where they are: The story of a teacher who became a builder*

---

## PART ONE: THE WEIGHT

### The Man Who Couldn't Wipe

Scott Somers couldn't wipe his own backside.

At 363 pounds, every morning was a negotiation with gravity. Every flight of stairs, a reminder that his body was giving up on him. His A1c screamed 14.7—diabetic, dying, deteriorating.

He was 44 years old. Father of three. Husband to Alana Terry, a USA Today bestselling author. Twenty years pouring his life into teenagers as a youth pastor, and now his own body was betraying him.

The doctor's words haunted him: *"If you don't change something, you won't see 50."*

Scott looked at his son Timmy—Tic, they called him—this gangly teenager who needed his dad. Not a memory. Not a cautionary tale. His *dad*.

So Scott did what desperate men do.

"Hey, Tic. Want to work out with your old man?"

### Iron and Love Language

What started as survival became something else entirely.

Five to six days a week. Two hours a day. Father and son descended into their unfinished basement in Glennallen, Alaska—population 439, where -50°F winters don't ask permission and the wind cuts through everything soft.

They lifted iron. They sweated. They suffered *together*.

And they talked. Oh, how they talked.

"Dad, you're getting weak," Tic would say, that sarcastic edge sharpening his teenage voice.

"Shut up, idiot," Scott would fire back, spotting his son on another personal record.

"After you, moron."

It was their love language. Forged in iron and discipline and the kind of raw honesty that only comes when you're both too exhausted to hide.

**363 pounds became 254 pounds.**  
**A1c 14.7 became 5.1—without medication.**  
**A dying man became a disciple of discipline.**

But more than that: a father and son who could have drifted apart instead became inseparable. 

Now Tic walks into Scott's office every single day for 20-40 minutes. Not because he has to. Because he *wants to*. After Scott became his teacher—a situation that could have destroyed their relationship—they came out *closer*.

That's not just a fitness transformation. That's *Romans 5:3-4* made flesh: suffering producing perseverance, perseverance producing character, character producing hope.

## PART TWO: THE ACCIDENT

### September 2023: A Cross Country Meet and a Question

Scott stood in the early autumn cold watching Tic run a cross country meet. Between heats, someone mentioned the school district was desperately seeking substitute teachers.

"You should do it," they said. "With your youth pastor experience, you could totally hack it."

Scott laughed. Teaching? Him? He had exactly **zero** classroom experience. But twenty years with teenagers meant he could handle middle schoolers.

Right?

**Fall 2023: The First Day**

He walked into a high school classroom as a substitute. Then moved to middle school in December. The challenge? Subbing in his own son's 8th grade class.

In a school with only 40 middle schoolers total, there was nowhere to hide.

### December 2023: When Everything Broke

The vice principal went on extended medical leave for back issues. A teacher stepped up temporarily to fill the VP role. Scott became the long-term substitute for that teacher's classes—Math and Social Studies for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders.

Half-day. Manageable.

Then came the call.

### January 2024: The Principal Vanished

The day before school returned from Christmas break, Scott got a cryptic message: *"Come in early tomorrow. You never know what might happen."*

He showed up to discover the principal had resigned and *left the state without telling anyone*.

The teacher Scott was subbing for became Acting Principal overnight.

Scott stepped into full-time teaching.

**No training. No warning. No escape.**

### Spring 2024: Falling in Love on Purpose

Here's the thing nobody tells you about teaching: you can stumble into it by accident, but you can only stay if you fall in love on purpose.

Scott fell *hard*.

He got his Emergency Certification to boost his pay beyond substitute rates. Then he went all-in: applied for the full-time position, got hired for the 2024-25 school year, enrolled in a Master's program in Elementary Education.

**December 2025:** He graduates. Fully certified. No longer accidental.

But by then, the accident had already become a calling.

---

## PART THREE: THE HALLWAY FLOOR

### What Nobody Sees

You want to know what makes Scott different from every curriculum company trying to sell you something?

He sits on the hallway floor.

When a 6th grader is crying—really crying, the kind that comes from a place deeper than failed math tests—Scott doesn't stand over them. He sits down. Eye to eye. On the cold linoleum floor outside his classroom.

"I can't promise it'll get better," he tells them, his voice quiet enough that only they can hear. "But I'll be with you."

That's not a teaching technique from a manual. That's *incarnational* education. That's Jesus-with-skin-on.

### The Daily Liturgy

Every Monday, without fail, Scott tells his students the same thing:

**"My life is better because you're in it."**

Not *will be* better once you pass the test. Not *would be* better if you behaved. *Is* better. Right now. Because *you exist*.

He means it. They know he means it.

He walks the halls giving fist bumps. He admits when he screws up (and he screws up—he's mediocre at math and doesn't hide it). He breaks into "Ice Ice Baby" mid-lesson. He makes terrible dad jokes.

And then there's the grounding.

"You're grounded," he says to a random 7th grader walking down the hall. Not because they did anything wrong. Just because they're *there*. Just to say: I see you. You matter.

Sometimes he walks into his classroom from the office while students are working. "You're all grounded," he announces.

The entire class groans in unison. "*Mr. Somers*..."

They love it. He loves them.

### The Gallery

Scott's classroom walls are covered with student drawings of him. Every quarter, he starts fresh, but he keeps *every single drawing* he's ever received—stored carefully, treasured.

The art is spectacular in its honesty:

- His bearded face (chest-length salt-and-pepper) and bald head (shaved, not naturally bald) on a ballerina body
- Him walking around in his Glennallen t-shirt uniform (he has 7-8 distinct Glennallen shirts and black pants—wears the same style every day, the kids notice *everything*)
- Whatever their 11-13-year-old imaginations dream up

Every time he sees a new drawing, he tells them how much he loves it. And he means it.

Because it's not about the art. It's about them knowing: *You made something, and I see it, and it matters.*

"In my heart," Scott says, "I never progressed past being a 13-year-old boy."

That's not a weakness. That's his *superpower*.

### The Numbers That Matter

Teaching 6th-8th graders in rural Alaska is what Scott calls "herding cats and chickens while juggling lawnmowers."

But here's what the data doesn't capture:

- The kid who stopped cutting because Mr. Somers noticed
- The student who actually turned in homework because someone finally believed they could
- The teenager who didn't drop out because one adult said, "I see you, and you matter"

Scott's not changing test scores. He's changing *lives*.

And he's doing it in one of America's harshest educational environments.

## PART FOUR: GLENNALLEN

### Population 439

You want to understand Scott Somers? You have to understand Glennallen.

**Population:** 439 souls  
**Location:** 189 miles northeast of Anchorage  
**Winter:** -50°F isn't a warning. It's Tuesday.  
**Demographics:** 65% Alaska Native (Ahtna Athabascan)  
**School Status:** Title 1 (high poverty, federal funding)

This isn't suburban comfort. This is *frontier* education.

Kids ride the bus an hour each way—sometimes longer when the roads ice over. They come from homes where subsistence hunting puts food on the table. Where power outages aren't inconveniences; they're survival tests.

Scott didn't choose Glennallen because it was easy. He ended up there because God has a sense of humor.

But here's what matters: **If Scott's methods work here, they'll work anywhere.**

### The Alaska Native Integration

Scott doesn't impose curriculum ON his students. He builds it WITH them.

- **Ahtna language lessons** woven into social studies
- **Subsistence learning** (moose dissection, salmon hatching, traditional crafts)
- **Cultural respect** without performative virtue signaling
- Real relationships with Alaska Native families

This isn't DEI training from some corporate manual. This is *love*. This is honoring the image-bearers God placed in his classroom.

### The Harsh Credential

When Scott tells homeschool parents, "I've taught in one of America's harshest educational environments," he's not exaggerating.

Title 1 school. Rural isolation. Extreme poverty. Cultural complexity. -50°F winters that test everything soft.

And his students *thrive*.

That's not theory. That's boots-on-the-ground proof.

---

## PART FIVE: THE BELOVED

### Alana Terry: USA Today Bestselling Author

Scott's wife isn't just supportive. She's a *force*.

**Alana Terry:**
- USA Today bestselling author (Christian suspense/fiction)
- Hosts **"Praying Christian Women"** podcast (built-in homeschool audience)
- Co-hosts **"True Crime Junkies"** (Christian true crime)
- Primary audience: Christian women (many of whom homeschool)

**The Partnership:**

Together, Scott and Alana co-wrote *Leviathan Rising*—a post-apocalyptic Christian thriller set in Glennallen, Alaska.

The plot? An AI named Leviathan decides to "prune" humanity.

The irony? Scott, who wrote about AI as antagonist, is now using AI to revolutionize education.

**Alana's role in The Accidental Teacher:** Still being defined. Advisory board? Marketing partner? Co-founder? Podcast platform?

What's certain: She believes in this. She's all-in.

### Tic: The Son Who Became a Man

**Timmy Somers** (they call him Tic) is now a 10th grader.

- **6 college credits** while in high school
- **School board student representative**
- **Student council officer**
- **4-sport athlete** (letterman, though the school doesn't officially award letterman jackets)
- **245 lbs bench press** (has surpassed his dad in almost every lift)

But here's what matters most:

Tic walks into Scott's office every single day for 20-40 minutes. Not because he's in trouble. Not because it's required.

Because he *wants* to talk to his dad.

They discuss everything: relationships, religion, life, stupid stuff, serious stuff. They maintain their sarcastic banter ("too cool" at school, but doesn't flinch when Scott hugs him in the hallway).

At a small school, all of Tic's friends love "Mr. Timmy's Dad."

**Most teachers who teach their own kids survive it.**  
**Scott and Tic came out closer.**

### Yaya: The Daughter in Fairbanks

Scott's older daughter attends the University of Alaska Fairbanks, studying architecture. The distance is hard—Fairbanks winters are even more brutal than Glennallen's.

In *Leviathan Rising*, Yaya and Tic merged into one character. In real life, they're three years apart, different personalities, navigating their own paths.

Scott prays for her. Misses her. Trusts God with her journey.

---

## PART SIX: THE AI SUMMER

### A Pop-Up and a Dream

Summer 2024. Scott clicked on something he shouldn't have—a pop-up for Ninja AI's "advanced program."

He had a ridiculous idea: build a website that could generate a full 100,000-word novel.

**It tried. It failed.** The LLM was too weak (probably GPT-4.0, before the renaissance).

**But Scott caught the bug.**

### Zero to Full-Stack in Six Months

June 2024: Uploading zip files to Netlify like a caveman discovering fire.

December 2024: **Programming with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-4.1 Codex**, building full-stack websites with capabilities that would make most bootcamp grads jealous.

**Scott's secret?**

**"I can't write a word of code, but I can create amazing works."**

He calls it "vibe-coding." AI researchers call it "prompt engineering." Scott just calls it *collaboration*.

He's received what he describes as a "master-level course in AI development"—all self-taught, all through partnership with machines that never sleep and never judge.

### The Aha Moment: World Geography

Scott *hated* the World Geography curriculum.

Bloated. Boring. Built by corporations who'd never stood on a frozen playground in -50°F Alaska, watching kids with numb fingers try to care about the Nile River.

So he built his own.

**The MAPS Project (Modular Adaptive Personalized System):**
- Gamified curriculum for World Geography
- Alaska Native cultural integration
- **Personalization** at scale
- Built in his basement. By a guy who can't code.

His students loved it. Their parents noticed. Scott realized:

*If I can do this for World Geography... I can do this for EVERYTHING.*

### The Villain Origin Story

Then Scott almost got burned.

A curriculum company reached out. They loved his work. They wanted to "partner."

Scott, naive and hopeful, almost signed away everything.

Until Alana stepped in. Until he read the contract. Until he realized:

**They wanted to exploit him the same way they exploit every homeschool family.**

That's when The Accidental Teacher was born.

Not as a side hustle. As a *mission*.

"I'm not going to let someone else do to families what they almost did to me."

---

## PART SEVEN: THE DEACON, THE PRESIDENT, AND THE IMPOSSIBLE SCHEDULE

### Sunday Mornings in Glennallen

Before the sun rises over the Wrangell Mountains, Scott is already awake.

Sunday school at Glennallen Community Chapel doesn't teach itself. Neither does the youth group he leads every week. And as a deacon—one of the spiritual shepherds of this tiny congregation in the middle of nowhere—he carries burdens that don't show up on any resume.

He's also president of the church board. Which means when the furnace breaks at -30°F, Scott's phone rings. When families are struggling and need help from the benevolence fund, Scott's the one making decisions.

### The Other Board

Then there's the Copper River Basin Child Advocacy Center.

Scott serves as president of the board for an organization that exists to protect the most vulnerable children in one of Alaska's most remote regions. Kids who've been abused. Kids who've been abandoned. Kids who need an adult to stand between them and the worst humanity has to offer.

It's not glamorous work. It's not fun. But it's *necessary*.

And Scott has never walked away from necessary.

### The Juggling Act

So when people ask how he manages everything:

- **Full-time teaching** (6th-8th grade, Math & Social Studies)
- **Finishing a Master's degree** (graduating December 2025)
- **Building The Accidental Teacher** business
- **Deacon** at Glennallen Community Chapel
- **President of TWO boards** (Child Advocacy Center + church)
- **Teaching Sunday school and youth group**
- **Husband to Alana, father of three**

Scott laughs.

"Balance? What is this BALANCE you speak of?"

Then he gets serious.

"Honestly, I do this because I have leveraged Artificial Intelligence."

He's not bragging. He's testifying.

AI doesn't replace his humanity. It *multiplies* his capacity. 

The heart is still his. The love is still his. The sitting-on-hallway-floors-with-crying-sixth-graders is still his. The Sunday school lessons are still his. The board meetings where he fights for vulnerable kids—those are still his.

But the curriculum building? The website development? The systems that would take a team of ten people months to create?

**AI makes him a one-man army.**

And he's using that army to storm the gates of educational mediocrity.

## PART SEVEN: HOW IS HE ALIVE?

"Balance? What is this BALANCE you speak of?"

That's Scott's answer when you ask how he manages:

- **Full-time teaching** (6th-8th grade, Math & Social Studies)
- **Finishing a Master's degree** (completes December 2025)
- **Building The Accidental Teacher** business
- **Deacon** at Glennallen Community Chapel
- **President of TWO boards** (Copper River Basin Child Advocacy Center + church)
- **Teaching Sunday school and youth group**
- **Husband to Alana, father of three**
- **Daily gym sessions with Tic**

"Honestly," Scott says, "I do this because I have leveraged Artificial Intelligence."

He's not bragging. He's testifying.

AI doesn't replace his humanity. It *multiplies* his capacity. The heart is still his. The love is still his. The sitting-on-hallway-floors is still his.

But the curriculum building? The website development? The systems that would take a team of ten to create?

And he's using that army to storm the gates of educational mediocrity.

## PART EIGHT: THE MISSION

### What Scott Sees (And What He Can't Unsee)

Walk into any public school in America. Watch the teachers.

They're not teaching to *children*. They're teaching to *tests*. To data points. To standardized metrics that reduce a thirteen-year-old human being with dreams and fears and a complicated home life into a bubble sheet.

Scott sees it. He lives it. He *hates* it.

The bureaucratic bloat. The endless meetings about nothing. The way relationships get crushed under the weight of accountability systems designed by people who haven't been in a classroom in twenty years.

And then there are the homeschool curriculum companies.

Oh, the curriculum companies.

Expensive garbage nobody asked for. One-size-fits-all pretending to be personalized. Corporate suits in conference rooms hundreds of miles away, deciding what's best for families they've never met, kids they'll never know, contexts they'll never understand.

Zero innovation. Maximum profit. Minimum love.

Scott almost became their tool. Their "proof of concept." Their way to slap "AI-enhanced" on the same tired garbage they've been selling for decades.

**Never again.**

### The Anti-Curriculum Company

**The Accidental Teacher isn't a curriculum company.**

It's an *anti*-curriculum company.

Built by a teacher who sits on hallway floors. Who tells his students every week their lives make his better. Who hangs their terrible drawings of his bald head on ballerina bodies and calls them *art*.

Built by a man who lost 109 pounds because he refused to let his son grow up without a dad. Who accidentally fell into teaching and fell in love on purpose. Who went from zero code to full-stack websites in six months because AI gave him superpowers.

Built by a Reformed Baptist deacon and youth pastor who knows that every child—*every single one*—is made in the image of God and deserves to be treated like it.

Built by a conservative libertarian constitutionalist who believes families should have the freedom to educate their kids without government overreach or corporate exploitation.

### The Five Non-Negotiables

1. **Meet kids where they are** - not where curriculum designers think they should be
2. **Gamify education** - make it irresistible, not insufferable  
3. **Cut the bloat** - give families what they want, nothing they don't
4. **AI-enhanced personalization** - true adaptation, not corporate buzzwords
5. **Relationship-focused** - "My life is better because you're in it"

### Why Scott Is Different

Scott isn't an ed-tech bro from Silicon Valley pitching vaporware to VCs.

He's not an ivory tower theorist with three PhDs and zero classroom hours.

He's not a curriculum company executive who hasn't talked to a real student in a decade.

**Scott is:**

- A **real teacher** in one of America's **harshest educational environments**
- Proven results with **Alaska Native students in a Title 1 school at -50°F**
- A **youth pastor of 20+ years** who knows how to build relationships that last
- A **self-taught AI master** who went from zero to full-stack in six months
- A **father** who turned working out with his son into discipleship
- A **deacon and board president** who serves the most vulnerable

And every Monday, he tells a classroom of middle schoolers:

**"My life is better because you're in it."**

That's not marketing. That's *conviction*.

And conviction changes everything.

## THE INVITATION

This isn't just Scott's story.

This is the story of every parent who's burned out on bloated curriculum.

Every student who's been crushed by standardized testing.

Every teacher who knows there's a better way but doesn't have the tools.

Every homeschool family that just wants someone to *meet their kid where they are*.

Scott Somers was dying at 363 pounds. He accidentally became a teacher. He discovered AI could multiply his capacity without replacing his heart.

Now he's building The Accidental Teacher.

Not because it's profitable. Because it's *necessary*.

**If it works in Glennallen, Alaska—population 439, Title 1, -50°F winters, 65% Alaska Native—it'll work anywhere.**

That's not a pitch. That's a *promise*.
