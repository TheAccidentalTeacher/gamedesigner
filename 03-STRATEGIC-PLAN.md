- **Public presence** (conferences, media, speaking) (20%)

## 🎯 WHICH TIER IS RIGHT?

### Framework for Decision

Ask these questions:

1. **How much risk can Scott/family tolerate?**
   - Low → Tier 1
   - Medium → Tier 2
   - High → Tier 3

2. **What's the teaching situation?**
   - Must stay full-time → Tier 1
   - Can go part-time → Tier 2
   - Ready to leave → Tier 2 or 3

3. **What's the market validation?**
   - Just an idea → Tier 1
   - Some traction → Tier 2
   - Proven demand → Tier 3

4. **What's Greg's capacity?**
   - Small investment → Tier 1
   - Serious seed round → Tier 2
   - VC-level commitment → Tier 3

5. **What's Scott's dream?**
   - Side business → Tier 1
   - Replace teaching income → Tier 2
   - Change the world → Tier 3

---

## 🚀 RECOMMENDATION

**Start with Tier 1, build toward Tier 2, keep Tier 3 as vision.**

**Why:**
- Tier 1 proves the concept with minimal risk
- Tier 2 becomes realistic once Tier 1 succeeds
- Tier 3 is the long-term vision that guides architecture decisions

**But build Tier 1 with Tier 3 in mind:**
- Use modular, scalable tech stack from day one
- Create brand identity that works at any scale
- Collect data/metrics that prove value proposition
- Build community and network effects early

---

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

1. **Scott decides which tier feels right** (or proposes hybrid)
2. **Answer Greg's questions** using appropriate tier framework
3. **Build prospectus website** showing all three tiers
4. **Create demo/test account** (use existing MAPS or build simple prototype)
5. **Schedule call with Greg** to walk through plans
6. **Formalize agreement** if Greg wants to invest

**Last Updated:** December 5, 2025  
**Status:** Awaiting Scott's decision on preferred tier
