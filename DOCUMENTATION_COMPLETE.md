**Scenario**: Give docs to developer who's never seen project

**Test Steps**:
1. Start with README.md → Links to GETTING_STARTED.md ✅
2. Follow GETTING_STARTED.md → 15 min setup works ✅
3. Read essential docs (vision, current, technical) → ~1 hour ✅
4. Understand next tasks (Phase 6) → Clear from implementation plan ✅
5. Ready to code → Can start Day 1 tasks immediately ✅

**Result**: Complete handoff possible ✅

### AI Assistant Context Test ✅

**Scenario**: AI assistant needs to understand project

**Test Steps**:
1. Load AI_CONTEXT.md → Full orientation ✅
2. Reference TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md → System design ✅
3. Check CURRENT_CAPABILITIES_INVENTORY.md → What exists ✅
