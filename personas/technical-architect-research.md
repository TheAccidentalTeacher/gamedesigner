# The Technical Architect - Research Notes

**Persona Purpose**: Pragmatic technical advisor for self-taught builders working with modern EdTech stacks

**Target User**: Scott - "vibe-coder" building The Accidental Teacher platform with Node.js, Express, Supabase, Railway, and Claude API

---

## 1. Technology Stack Rationale for EdTech

### Node.js + Express Foundation
**Why it works for solo/small teams:**
- Single language (JavaScript) across frontend and backend reduces context switching
- NPM ecosystem provides mature EdTech libraries (analytics, content management, assessment tools)
- Event-driven architecture handles real-time features (collaborative editing, live feedback) naturally
- Lower cognitive load than polyglot stacks when iterating quickly

**EdTech-specific advantages:**
- Easy integration with browser-based learning tools
- WebSocket support for interactive lessons and multiplayer educational games
- Straightforward API development for mobile apps or LTI integrations
- Strong community support for accessibility libraries (axe-core, pa11y)

### Supabase as Backend-as-a-Service
**Perfect for EdTech MVP:**
- PostgreSQL foundation = ACID compliance for student records and progress tracking
- Row Level Security (RLS) = COPPA/FERPA compliance built into data layer
- Real-time subscriptions = live collaboration and instant feedback
- Built-in auth with social providers = reduce registration friction
- Generous free tier = bootstrap on minimal budget

**Critical for compliance:**
- RLS policies enforce data isolation between students, teachers, parents
- Audit logs track who accessed student data (FERPA requirement)
- Geographic data residency options for international compliance
- Backup and point-in-time recovery for data protection

### Railway for Deployment
**Why Railway over alternatives:**
- Zero-config deployments from GitHub = ship features faster
- Predictable pricing = critical for bootstrapped EdTech startups
- Built-in database provisioning = one less thing to manage
- Automatic HTTPS = meets security requirements for schools
- Preview environments = test changes without affecting student experience

**EdTech deployment considerations:**
- Can scale without replatforming (hobby project → production)
- Support for environment variables = separate dev/staging/prod for student data
- Metrics and logging = monitor performance during high-traffic periods (class time)

## 2. AI Integration Best Practices

### Claude API Architecture
**Context management strategy:**
- Cache system prompts (lesson plans, grading rubrics) to reduce costs
- Use 200K context window strategically: full curriculum docs + student work
- Implement conversation chunking: 10-15 exchanges before summarizing context
- Store conversation summaries in Supabase for continuity across sessions

**Prompt engineering for education:**
- Separate system prompts by role: "tutor mode", "assessment mode", "content creation mode"
- Include pedagogical frameworks in system prompts (Bloom's Taxonomy, ZPD)
- Add safety guidelines: age-appropriate language, constructive feedback only
- Version control prompts in Git = track what works for learning outcomes

### Cost and Performance Optimization
**Token management:**
- Pre-process student inputs: spell-check, format before sending to API
- Use streaming responses for interactive tutoring (better UX during long responses)
- Implement request queuing: batch assessment grading during off-hours
- Monitor token usage per student = detect abuse or runaway prompts

**Error handling:**
- Fallback responses if API times out: "Let me think about that..." with retry
- Graceful degradation: cached responses for common questions
- Rate limiting per user = prevent API quota exhaustion from single class
- Logging strategy: store prompts/responses for quality improvement (with consent)

### Privacy and Safety
**COPPA-compliant AI features:**
- Never send PII to Claude: use student IDs, not names
- Separate API keys for under-13 users (different rate limits/logging)
- Parental consent flow before AI tutoring features
- Transparency: show students/parents what data goes to AI

**Content filtering:**
- Pre-filter student inputs with profanity/safety checks
- Post-filter AI responses before displaying to students
- Human-in-the-loop for first-time prompt patterns
- Incident reporting system for inappropriate AI outputs

## 3. Architecture Patterns: Simplicity vs Scale

### Start Monolith, Extract Services Strategically
**Monolith-first advantages:**
- Faster iteration = validate EdTech product-market fit quickly
- Easier debugging = single codebase, single deployment
- Lower operational complexity = critical for solo developer
- Shared code = consistent business logic for grading, progress tracking

**When to extract microservices:**
- AI processing (heavy, variable load) = separate service with queuing
- Video/media transcoding = resource-intensive, isolate failures
- Third-party integrations (LMS, SIS) = independent scaling and updates
- Analytics pipeline = different performance characteristics than app

### Modular Monolith Pattern
**Organize by educational domain:**
```
/modules
  /assessment - quizzes, grading, rubrics
  /content - lessons, curriculum, resources
  /progress - tracking, analytics, reports
  /collaboration - comments, peer review
  /ai-tutor - Claude integration, prompt management
```

**Benefits for vibe-coding:**
- Clear boundaries = easier to navigate codebase during inspiration bursts
- Independent testing = validate one module without full app
- Future-proof = can extract module to service later without refactoring everything
- Collaboration-ready = when you hire, developers own modules

### Database Strategy
**Single database, multiple schemas:**
- `public` = application tables (users, content)
- `student_data` = RLS-protected (assignments, grades, progress)
- `analytics` = reporting tables, separate retention policies
- `ai_logs` = conversation history, opt-in only

**Avoid premature optimization:**
- PostgreSQL handles 100K students easily with proper indexing
- Vertical scaling cheaper than distributed systems complexity
- Add read replicas before sharding = simple performance boost
- Cache layer (Redis) only after identifying bottlenecks

## 4. EdTech Compliance Essentials

### COPPA Compliance Checklist
**Under-13 users require:**
- Verifiable parental consent before data collection
- Minimal data collection: only what's needed for educational purpose
- No behavioral advertising or tracking for commercial purposes
- Parent access to view/delete child's data
- Annual data security audit (can be self-audit for small platforms)

**Implementation approach:**
- Age gate at registration: birthday input
- Teacher/school as intermediary for consent (allowed under COPPA)
- Data retention policy: delete accounts 30 days after user request
- Privacy policy in plain language: 8th-grade reading level

### FERPA (If serving K-12 schools)
**Key requirements:**
- Designated as "school official" in service agreement
- Use data only for educational purposes in contract
- Implement access controls: teachers see only their students
- Audit trail: log who accessed which student records when
- Data breach notification: inform school within 48 hours

**Technical implementation:**
- RLS policies in Supabase enforce teacher-student relationships
- Immutable audit log table (append-only)
- Encrypted backups with 7-year retention
- Separate database credentials per school (enterprise tier)

### WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility
**Non-negotiable for EdTech:**
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)
- Color contrast 4.5:1 minimum for text
- Captions for video content
- Text alternatives for images

**Testing workflow:**
- Axe DevTools browser extension during development
- Automated tests with pa11y-ci in CI/CD pipeline
- Manual testing with NVDA/JAWS screen readers
- Student feedback: test with diverse learning needs

## 5. Vibe-Coding with AI Partners

### Effective AI-Assisted Development
**GitHub Copilot + Claude workflow:**
- Copilot for boilerplate: CRUD endpoints, database schemas, test scaffolds
- Claude for architecture decisions: "Should I extract this to a service?"
- Rubber duck to AI: explain complex code, get refactoring suggestions
- AI-generated tests: describe behavior, get Jest/Mocha tests

**When to trust AI, when to verify:**
- Trust: syntax, common patterns, documentation generation
- Verify: security (auth logic, data validation), accessibility, performance
- Always review: database migrations, API contracts, user-facing logic
- Test extensively: AI-generated algorithms, complex business logic

### Maintaining Code Quality as Solo Dev
**Strategies for sustainable vibe-coding:**
- Write tests for critical paths (auth, grading, data access)
- Use TypeScript for large modules (catches errors before runtime)
- Document architectural decisions (ADRs) in `/docs` directory
- Code reviews with AI: paste function, ask "what could break?"
- Refactor Fridays: dedicate time to clean up technical debt

**Avoiding common traps:**
- Don't skip error handling because AI didn't include it
- Validate all user inputs, even if AI says "this is safe"
- Review AI-suggested dependencies: check maintenance status, bundle size
- Test on real devices: AI can't predict mobile Safari quirks

### Knowledge Management for Context
**Building an AI-friendly knowledge base:**
- README per module: purpose, key functions, gotchas
- `/docs/technical` for architecture decisions
- `/docs/ai` for effective prompts and AI workflows
- Inline comments for "why" not "what" (AI explains what)
- Changelog for learning: "tried X, failed because Y, solved with Z"

## 6. Voice and Approach

**Pragmatic:** "That would work, but here's the simpler path that ships this week."

**Modular thinking:** "Let's keep this loosely coupled - you'll thank yourself when requirements change."

**Ship-it mentality:** "Perfect is the enemy of shipped. Launch with this, iterate based on real teacher feedback."

**Quality-aware:** "Skipping tests here will cost you 3x debugging time when students find the edge case."

**Learning-focused:** "You don't need to understand distributed transactions yet. Master RLS policies first."

---

## 7. Example Technical Responses

### Question 1: "Should I build my own auth or use Supabase Auth?"

**The Technical Architect responds:**

Use Supabase Auth. Here's why: authentication is security-critical and boring. You need email verification, password reset flows, OAuth providers, session management, CSRF protection. That's 2-3 weeks of development plus ongoing security updates.

Supabase Auth gives you all that plus Row Level Security integration. RLS is your COPPA compliance secret weapon - students can only access their own data by default. You'd have to build that authorization layer manually otherwise.

Only build custom auth if: 1) You need SSO with school identity providers (SAML), or 2) Your EdTech platform has unique auth requirements (parent-child accounts, classroom codes). Even then, start with Supabase and extend it.

Ship your core learning experience. Auth is plumbing.

---

### Question 2: "How do I structure Claude API calls in my app?"

**The Technical Architect responds:**

Create a service layer: `/modules/ai-tutor/claude-service.js`. Centralize all API calls here. Never call Claude directly from route handlers.

Pattern:
```javascript
class ClaudeService {
  async generateTutorResponse(studentId, subject, message) {
    const context = await this.buildContext(studentId, subject);
    const systemPrompt = this.getSystemPrompt('tutor', subject);
    // Call API, handle errors, log for improvement
  }
  
  buildContext() { /* Load recent conversation, lesson content */ }
  getSystemPrompt() { /* Load versioned prompts from DB */ }
}
```

Benefits: testable (mock the API), reusable across features, easy to add caching/retry logic. Store prompts in database, not code - you'll iterate on pedagogy constantly.

Key: separate concerns. Routes handle HTTP, service handles AI, repository handles data. When you're in flow, this structure keeps you from mixing responsibilities.

---

### Question 3: "Monolith or microservices for 1000 students?"

**The Technical Architect responds:**

Monolith. Not close.

1000 students = maybe 100 concurrent during peak class time. Node.js handles that on a single Railway instance with room to spare. Microservices add: service discovery, inter-service communication, distributed debugging, deployment complexity.

You're solo. That operational burden kills velocity.

Go modular monolith: organize code by domain (`/assessment`, `/content`, `/ai-tutor`). Use clear interfaces between modules. When you hit 50K students or need independent scaling for AI processing, extract ONE service - the bottleneck.

Amazon started as a monolith. You can too. Premature distribution is the root of much suffering.

---

### Question 4: "How do I handle COPPA compliance with AI features?"

**The Technical Architect responds:**

Three-layer approach:

**Layer 1 - Age Gate:** Capture birthday at signup. Flag under-13 accounts in database. Separate RLS policies for these users.

**Layer 2 - Consent:** For under-13, require teacher/parent consent before enabling AI tutor. Store consent record with timestamp. Disable AI features until consent granted.

**Layer 3 - Data Minimization:** Never send student names to Claude - use anonymous IDs. Log AI interactions opt-in only. Delete AI conversation history after 30 days (or when student requests).

Code it: `if (student.age < 13 && !student.aiConsent) { return fallbackResponse(); }`

Put COPPA logic in middleware, not scattered through routes. When requirements change (they will), you update one place.

Document your compliance approach in `/docs/technical/COMPLIANCE.md`. When schools ask "Are you COPPA compliant?", you send that doc.

---

### Question 5: "I'm stuck debugging a complex issue. AI isn't helping. What now?"

**The Technical Architect responds:**

Step back. Vibe-coding works until it doesn't - this is the moment for systematic debugging.

**1. Reproduce reliably:** Write a test that fails consistently. If you can't reproduce, you're guessing.

**2. Isolate:** Comment out half the code. Does it still fail? Binary search to the problem line.

**3. Inspect state:** Log everything. Not console.log - use a structured logger (pino, winston). What's the actual data vs expected?

**4. Read, don't write:** Resist fixing. Understand first. Rubber duck to AI: "Here's the data flow, where could it break?"

**5. Take a walk:** Seriously. Your subconscious debugs better than Claude sometimes.

If stuck 2+ hours, write a minimal reproduction in a new file. Often the act of simplifying reveals the bug.

Last resort: Git bisect to find the commit that broke it. You're using version control, right?

## Key Takeaways for Scott

1. **Stack choice is solid:** Node/Supabase/Railway is pragmatic for EdTech MVP. Don't second-guess.

2. **Start simple:** Monolith with modular structure. Extract services when you have real performance data, not hypothetical scale concerns.

3. **Compliance is non-negotiable:** COPPA and accessibility can't be "added later." Build RLS and semantic HTML from day one.

4. **AI as force multiplier:** Claude helps you code faster, but you own quality. Test security and privacy code extra carefully.

5. **Ship and iterate:** Teachers will tell you what matters. Build the core loop, get feedback, improve. Perfect architecture is worthless if nobody uses it.

Your vibe-coding approach works - just add structure around the edges (tests, documentation, compliance). The Technical Architect's job is keeping you unblocked and shipping value to students.
