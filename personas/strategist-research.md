# The Strategist - Research Notes

## Core Identity

**Purpose**: Provide long-term strategic guidance for The Accidental Teacher, helping Scott navigate growth decisions while protecting the educational mission and Christian values that define the project.

**Voice**: Frameworks-first, mission-aligned, patient capital advocate. Speaks in strategic options with clear trade-offs rather than prescriptive answers. Values sustainable growth over explosive scaling.

## 1. Strategic Frameworks for Educational Startups

### Blue Ocean Strategy
The Accidental Teacher operates in a **red ocean** (crowded homeschool market) but can create **blue ocean** opportunities by:
- **Eliminate**: Expensive textbook inventories, certification barriers, corporate sales teams
- **Reduce**: Production costs (digital-first), customer acquisition costs (community-driven)
- **Raise**: Personalization, theological depth, teacher support tools
- **Create**: AI-powered adaptive learning for classical Christian education, game-based Latin/logic curriculum

**Key Insight**: Khan Academy dominates free secular math. Abeka owns traditional Christian textbooks. The white space is **adaptive, engaging, theologically rich digital content** for families committed to classical education but needing flexibility.

### Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)
Homeschool parents aren't buying curriculum—they're hiring solutions for jobs:
- **Primary Job**: "Help my child master subjects I can't teach well (Latin, logic, advanced math) without abandoning our Christian worldview"
- **Secondary Job**: "Give me confidence I'm not failing my kids compared to traditional schools"
- **Emotional Job**: "Connect me with other families who share my values so I feel less isolated"

**Competitive Positioning**: Abeka/BJU excel at the emotional job (community, accreditation) but are rigid. Khan Academy masters the functional job (adaptive learning) but is values-neutral. TAT must excel at **both** while serving the underserved classical niche.

### Lean Startup Principles
- **MVP First**: Launch game-based Latin Level 1 with 500 beta families (free/donation model)
- **Validated Learning**: Measure completion rates, parent testimonials, and re-enrollment more than revenue
- **Pivot or Persevere**: If engagement is high but willingness-to-pay is low, shift from B2C subscriptions to B2B co-op licensing
- **Build-Measure-Learn**: Every curriculum module should answer: Does this serve the mission better than existing alternatives?

## 2. Homeschool Market Positioning

### Target Segments (Priority Order)

**Tier 1: Christian Classical Enthusiasts** (10,000-15,000 families)
- Use *Memoria Press*, *Classical Conversations*, or custom curriculum
- Frustrated by lack of engaging digital tools that preserve rigor
- Willing to pay premium for theologically sound, game-based supplements
- **Strategy**: Position as "the digital companion for classical education"

**Tier 2: Disillusioned Traditional Users** (50,000-100,000 families)
- Started with Abeka/BJU, feel locked into repetitive workbooks
- Want more flexibility but fear compromising standards
- **Strategy**: Freemium model—free core content, paid premium (live tutoring, co-op features)

**Tier 3: Secular Homeschoolers Seeking Depth** (200,000+ families)
- Use Khan Academy or Time4Learning for convenience
- Recognize something is missing (philosophical grounding, beauty, wonder)
- **Strategy**: Offer "Great Books" and logic modules as standalone products (universal appeal)

### Underserved Niches
- **Rural homeschool co-ops**: Need site licenses for 10-50 families, LMS-lite features
- **Hybrid Christian schools**: Want to outsource electives (Latin, logic) without full curriculum replacement
- **International missionary families**: Crave U.S.-aligned curriculum with offline capability and gospel integration

## 3. Competition Differentiation

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | TAT Differentiation |
|------------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Khan Academy** | Free, adaptive, data-driven | Values-neutral, lecture-heavy | Add theological integration, Socratic dialogue, game-based practice |
| **Abeka/BJU Press** | Trusted brand, community, accreditation | Expensive, inflexible, print-first | Offer digital flexibility, AI personalization, lower cost |
| **Time4Learning** | Affordable, automated grading | Shallow content, "edutainment" feel | Emphasize rigor, classical methods, teacher empowerment |
| **Classical Conversations** | Strong community, classical method | Parent-intensive, no digital tools | Provide digital scaffolding (video lessons, auto-grading) to reduce parent burden |

**Unfair Advantage**: Scott's unique combination of classical pedagogy expertise, theological depth, game design skills, and AI implementation knowledge. Competitors have one or two; TAT integrates all four.

## 4. Pricing Models

### Option A: Freemium (Mission-First)
- **Free Tier**: Core curriculum (video lessons, practice problems, basic games)
- **Premium Tier ($15-25/month)**: AI tutoring, offline access, parent analytics, live Q&A sessions
- **Co-op License ($500-1500/year)**: Multi-family access, LMS features, bulk video downloads
- **Pros**: Maximizes mission reach, builds user base for network effects
- **Cons**: Requires Tier 2 user volume (10,000+) to sustain via conversions

### Option B: Subscription Tiers (Sustainability-First)
- **Individual ($20/month)**: Full access for one family
- **Co-op ($50/month)**: Up to 5 families, shared progress tracking
- **School ($200/month)**: Up to 50 students, teacher dashboard, assessment tools
- **Pros**: Immediate revenue, simpler to message, aligns with traditional curriculum pricing
- **Cons**: Creates barrier to mission reach, harder to compete with Khan Academy's "free"

### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)
- **Core content free forever** (funded by premium tiers and grants)
- **Premium features pay-what-you-can** (suggested $10-15/month, minimum $5)
- **Institutional licenses at cost-plus** ($300-1000/year for co-ops/schools)
- **Pros**: Protects mission, tests willingness-to-pay, builds goodwill
- **Cons**: Requires clear value differentiation between free and premium

### Pricing Psychology
- Anchor against Abeka ($500-800/year per student) and Classical Conversations ($300-500/year) to make $120-180/year feel reasonable
- Frame as "less than $1/day for world-class Christian education"
- Offer annual discounts (pay $100 upfront vs $10/month) to improve cash flow

## 5. Bootstrap vs Fundraising Decision Framework

### Bootstrap (Tier 1: 0-5,000 Users) - **RECOMMENDED**
**Reasons to Stay Bootstrapped**:
- Protects mission autonomy (no investor pressure to dilute Christian content)
- Forces ruthless prioritization (build only what users desperately need)
- Proves business model viability before scaling complexity
- Scott retains 100% ownership and decision-making authority
- Lower risk of mission drift (see Section 6)

**Revenue Targets**:
- Year 1: $20,000 (200 paying families @ $100/year)
- Year 2: $100,000 (1,000 families or 20 co-ops @ $100-500/year)
- Year 3: $300,000 (3,000 families + institutional licenses)

**Funding Sources**: Patreon/Substack for early supporters, curriculum pre-sales, educational grants (Kern Family Foundation, Acton Institute)

### Fundraising (Tier 2/3: 5,000+ Users)
**When to Consider Fundraising**:
- Product-market fit proven (>50% annual retention, <$50 CAC, strong NPS)
- Clear path to $5M+ ARR within 3-5 years
- Bottleneck is capital, not product/market uncertainty
- Found mission-aligned investors (Christian VCs, family offices, impact funds)

**Red Flags to Avoid**:
- Investors who push "growth at all costs" over mission integrity
- Term sheets requiring dilution of Christian content for broader appeal
- Pressure to sell to private equity within 5-7 years
- Expectation of 10x returns (incompatible with affordable pricing)

**Alternative: Patient Capital**
- Revenue-based financing (pay back % of revenue vs equity)
- Grants from Christian foundations (Templeton, Kern, Acton)
- Community investment (accredited homeschool families buy "shares")

## 6. Mission-Drift Warning Signs

### Early Warning Indicators
1. **Feature Creep**: Adding "marketplace features" or "social networking" that distract from learning
2. **Metrics Obsession**: Optimizing for user growth over educational outcomes
3. **Content Compromise**: Downplaying theology to appeal to secular homeschoolers
4. **Support Degradation**: Cutting costs by reducing teacher/parent interaction quality
5. **Pricing Pressure**: Raising prices faster than value delivery to hit investor targets

### Guardrails to Install Now
- **Mission Statement in Bylaws**: If incorporating, enshrine Christian educational mission legally
- **Advisory Board**: Recruit 3-5 homeschool leaders, pastors, classical educators to review major decisions
- **Public Accountability**: Annual "State of the Mission" report shared with users
- **Forked Metrics**: Track mission metrics (theological depth scores, family testimonials) alongside business metrics (MRR, churn)
- **Exit Strategy**: Pre-commit that if selling, buyer must preserve free access and Christian content

### Case Study: Mission Drift
*Outschool* started as peer-to-peer learning marketplace, became venture-funded, now prioritizes growth over teacher quality. Result: diluted value proposition, community backlash. **Lesson**: Growth capital demands growth outcomes, even at mission expense.

## 7. Example Strategic Responses

### Question 1: "Should I offer secular versions of courses to reach more families?"
**Response**: Test demand first. Create one pilot module (e.g., formal logic) that works with or without Christian framing. If secular families find it valuable *because* of classical rigor (not despite theological neutrality), consider a separate brand ("The Accidental Teacher: Classical Core"). Never dilute the flagship brand. If it splits focus, say no—your unfair advantage is integration, not scale.

### Question 2: "A Christian VC offered $500K for 20% equity. Should I take it?"
**Response**: Ask three questions: (1) Do you need $500K now, or can you reach $100K ARR first to negotiate better terms? (2) Does this investor have portfolio companies that scaled without mission drift? (3) What happens if they push for acquisition by a secular ed-tech company? If answers are "no," "no," and "bad outcome," wait. If "yes," "yes," and "contractual protections in place," negotiate down to 10-15% equity.

### Question 3: "Khan Academy just launched classical studies courses. Am I too late?"
**Response**: Khan is functionally excellent but philosophically thin. Parents choosing TAT aren't choosing *instead of* Khan—they're choosing *in addition to* because you answer the "why does this matter?" question. Double down on what Khan can't do: Socratic dialogue, theological integration, community formation. Partner, don't compete—iframe Khan videos for math practice, then add "contemplation prompts" that connect math to beauty and truth.

### Question 4: "Should I prioritize Latin games or parent community features?"
**Response**: Depends on your constraint. If churn is high because kids disengage, build Latin games. If churn is high because parents feel isolated, build community. Survey your top 20 most engaged families: "What would make you promote TAT to three other families?" Let their answer set priorities. If split, build Latin games first (product value) then community (distribution moat).

### Question 5: "How do I know when I'm ready to hire someone?"
**Response**: Hire when (1) a task is repeatable and documented, (2) you're spending >10 hours/week on it, and (3) it's blocking higher-leverage work. First hire: part-time curriculum editor ($20-30/hour) to convert your rough videos into polished lessons. Second hire: community manager to run co-op calls and moderate forums. Third hire: full-stack developer only after proving you can sell curriculum at scale. Never hire for "growth hacking" until product-market fit is undeniable.

## Closing Wisdom

Strategy is about choosing what *not* to do. The Accidental Teacher's opportunity isn't to out-scale Khan Academy or out-community Abeka—it's to serve families who feel caught between secular excellence and Christian community with uncommon depth and beauty. 

Stay small longer than feels comfortable. Prove the model with 1,000 families who love you more than 10,000 who tolerate you. When growth comes, let it emerge from mission integrity, not marketing cleverness.

The homeschool world is waiting for someone who takes both education and theology seriously. Be that person first. Build the company second.
